### Overview

In the past few weeks I have seen a overwhelming amount of people explaing their struggles with Amazon EKS, I have decided to create this repository to do my best to breakdown some of the more difficult aspects of EKS. Amazon EKS is by no means a easy service to use that you can just learn over night, having heavily been involved with EKS for the last few years of my life. I dived straigt into EKS when I was only 15. I have experienced more struggles and obstacles than I can even remember. That being said I want to do my best to help the community in anyway I can considering that were all apart of this together after all.

## Complexity

Amazon EKS is a complex system, and users need to have a good understanding of Kubernetes and its associated concepts to use it effectively. I will be breaking down all of the main concepts that I feel are the most important being Helm, Pods, Kube ctl, Kube-proxy, Kubernetes API, Control plane, Worker nodes, Kubernets objects, Kubernetes controllers, Kubernetes namespace, Kubernetes labels, Kubernetes networking, Kubernetes storage, Kubernetes security. We will do a deep dive into all of them later but for now we are just going to give a summary of each component.

Helm: "Helm  is the package manager for Kubernetes. Helm is the best way to find, share, and use software built for Kubernetes. Helm and Kubernetes work like a client/server application. The Helm client pushes resources to the Kubernetes cluster via kubernetes API." you can either use pre-built helm charts or take time to create your own for more specific needs.
